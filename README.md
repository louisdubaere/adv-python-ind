# Individual Python Assignment using Dask

This project predicts the amount of shared bikes that get used in Washington per hour.
It makes use of Dask.

## Getting Started

This section goes over the packages you need to install in order to run the code.

### Prerequisites

The Python Notebook makes use of 3 different packages namely: 

* **Dask**: A package that provides advanced parallelism for analytics, enabling performance at scale.
* **Dask ML**: A package that provides scalable machine learning in Python using Dask.
* **Scikit Learn**: A package for Machine Learning in Python, that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis

It is required that these packages are installed in the environment where the Python Notebook is ran.

This can be done using Anconda-Navigator or by running following commands in the terminal

```
conda install dask
```

```
conda install dask-ml
```

```
conda install scikit-learn
```

## Running the notebook

The notebook can be opened and ran with Jupyter Notebook in an environment with the required packages installed.

## The Data

The data can be found on [the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset).
